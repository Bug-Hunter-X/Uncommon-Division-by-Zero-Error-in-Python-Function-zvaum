# Uncommon Division by Zero Error in Python

This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Python related to division by zero. The `function_with_uncommon_error` function demonstrates a weakness in exception handling where division by zero is handled only when 'b' is zero, ignoring the case where 'a' is zero and 'b' is not.

The solution provides an improved version of the function that checks for both conditions effectively before division.  This shows the importance of thorough input validation and exception handling in functions.
